3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > Code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End Project (Chatbook Class)
    > function vs method
    > Magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can attribute outside a class

    INTERVIEW ROUND
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
