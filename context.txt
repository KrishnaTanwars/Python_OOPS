1. Class and Oject(Example)
2. Class has data/attribute and methods/functions
    > Code Walkthorugh
    > Attributes called itself,methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > Code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End Project (Chatbook Class)
    > function vs method
    > Magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can attribute outside a class

    INTERVIEW ROUND
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method


6. Inheritance 
    > Inheritance code Example
    > Why inheritance is needed? ( Code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets inherited? - constructor, non private attribute, non private methods 
    > constructor overloading & Method overloading
    > Super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
